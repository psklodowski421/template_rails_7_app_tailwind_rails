## What is Bento?

Bento is a modern and vanilla Rails 7 stack which adheres to the [Rails doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/) as much as possible. It's a starter template for building wonderful software products with Rails.

I created this template so you can hit the ground running and focus on your project without wasting time on boilerplate code.

### What's in the box?

Bento is designed to be lean and healthy with all the essentials for a productive and enjoyable development/testing workflow.

It provides a few staples:

- All the major [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 7 defaults (except for Test Unit in favour of Rspec)
- Modern JavaScript bundled with [ES Build](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) via the [JS Bundling](https://github.com/rails/jsbundling-rails) gem
- Modern CSS powered by Dart Sass and the [CSS Bundling](https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails) gems
- [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) Stack ([Turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) & [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwire.dev/)) for SPA-like JavaScript sprinkles without the SPA complexity.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for easy JavaScript testing. See `app/javascript/controllers` for an example
- [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) for background jobs
- [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) for unit and system tests along with [simplecov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) for coverage support 
- [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) with headless [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) integration tests and a pre-configured [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) config ready to go. See `spec/system` for an example.
